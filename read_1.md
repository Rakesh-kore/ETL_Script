Step-by-Step Solution
1. Project Setup
Ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

Docker
Docker-compose
AWS CLI Local
Psql

2. Create a Docker-Compose File
Create a docker-compose.yml file to set up the necessary services (Localstack and Postgres):

3. Create the Python Script
Create a Python script etl.py to read messages from SQS, mask PII, and write to Postgres.

4. Create a README File
Create a README.md to explain how to run your application and summarize your thought process.

5. Running the Project
	A.Start Docker Services:
	docker-compose up

	B. Run the ETL Script:
	python etl.py

6. Testing
Verify that the data is written to the Postgres database:
psql -d postgres -U postgres -p 5432 -h localhost -W
postgres=# select * from user_logins;

This solution outlines the steps to read from an AWS SQS queue, mask PII data, and write to a Postgres database. Ensure to adapt the code and configurations based on your specific requirements and environment.
